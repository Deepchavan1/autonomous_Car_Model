# autonomous_Car_Model
## Getting started with Carla
Carla is an open-source autonomous driving environment that also comes with a Python API to interact with it. Carla helps us to create an environment where we can use a car mounted with a bunch of sensors to emulate real-life self-driving car
## Setting Carla enviornment
First of all we will have to download Carla's latest version [0.9.13](https://carla.org/2021/11/16/release-0.9.13/). Now firstly we will create a virtual enviornment as this verison of Carla needs python 3.7 version. Virtual enviornment will be created using miniconda. 
> $ conda create -n autocar python=3.7
